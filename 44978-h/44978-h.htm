<p>A very few 'slips' have met my eyes on a final reading. They are&mdash;as
says an ancient Divine&mdash;"as easily corrected as espied." Nevertheless
they are here recorded that the Reader of his charity may put them
right, and any others that may have escaped Editor and Printer. In
<i>Nosce Teipsum</i>, the heading and head-line (Vol. I., pp. 25, 26 onward)
has 'Immortalitie' misprinted 'Immortalite'&mdash;a common contemporary
spelling&mdash;but it is 'tie' in the title-page (p. 5): <i>ib.</i> p. 80, l.
15, read 'be best.' In <i>Hymnes to Astræa</i>, <i>ib.</i> p. 147, l. 3, remove
period (.) after 'rayes.' In <i>Orchestra</i>, <i>ib.</i> p. 181, st. 53, l. 7,
read 'perfect-cunning': p. 185, foot-note 7, put G. at end: p. 192, st.
81, l. 7, 'Ply' = entwine (omitted): p. 194, foot-note 7, is 'coach,'
not 'couch': p. 202, l. 10, 'shoe' was the contemporary spelling: p.
204, st. 113, l. 6, insert 'it' before 'shine.'&mdash;G.</p>

<p>I am indebted to the Bodleian copy&mdash;among Malone's books&mdash;for my text
of these 'Epigrams.' I have preferred this edition to the two others
that preceded, inasmuch as, while it, like them, bears the imprint of
'Middlebourgh,' there seems no reason to doubt that it was printed in
London: therefore most probably under the author's eye. The volume is a
small 12mo. and the following is the title-page:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Rev. Alexander Dyce in his collective edition of the Works of
Marlowe, has given Davies' "Epigrams" <i>in extenso</i>, with a painstaking
collation of the various readings from the other two editions (both
undated) together with similar various readings from a Manuscript
discovered by him in the Harleian Collection (1836.) Mr. Dyce with
reference to his reprint of the 'Epigrams,' and the foregoing MS. says,
"I have given them with the text considerably improved by means of one
of the Harleian MSS." ('Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> Account of Marlowe and his Writings: p.
xl: edition 1862.) I must demur to this alleged 'improvement.' The MS.
has no authority whatever, the Scribe being an extremely ignorant and
blundering one. These nine examples out of many, taken at random, will
suffice to prove this:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>[1] Epigram 1, line first.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Fly, merry Muse unto that merry towne &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he actually reads, spite of its heading 'Ad Musam'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Fly, merry Newes....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>[2] Epigram 2, line 14</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And stands, in Presence, stroaking up his haire'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he gives, to neglect of the rhyme with 'yeare'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'...... stroaking up his heade'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>[3] Epigram 3, line 5, for 'fry' he stupidly reads 'cry.'</p>

<p>[4] Epigram 13, line 9, for 'sectaries' he gives nonsensically
'scituaries.'</p>

<p>[5] Epigram 15, line 3.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Thou with harsh noise the ayre doth rudely breake,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he transmogrifies into</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'...... horse nor sea the ayre doth.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>[6] Epigram 26, line 11, he substitutes 'sweete' for 'hot' oblivious
of the rhyme with 'petticoat.'</p>

<p>[7] Epigram 36, line 19, for 'rarifie' he reads 'ratiffie'[!]</p>

<p>[8] Epigram 41, line 2,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Paulus, in spite of enuy, fortunate'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he gives thus</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Paulus, in fight of envy'......<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<p>[9] Epigram 43, line 3, for 'Paris-garden' he has 'Parish-garden;' and
so on ludicrously, with numerous proper names.</p></div>

<p>Any one capable of perpetrating such stupidities as these, ought not in
my opinion, to be allowed to displace a text printed for the Author,
more especially his cannot for a moment be allowed to over-bear the
third edition, our text.</p>

<p>From a confused inscription on the first page of the MS. its probable
writer is ascertained. It is as follows "Ex spoliis Richardi Wharfe,
ex...... It is much trouble and much.... Ex spoliis R. W." Underneath
is the book-plate of John, Duke of Newcastle. The general title
runs "Epigramma in Musam, like Buckminster's Allmanacks servinge
generallie for all England: but especiallie for the meridian of this
famous Cittie of London." I regret that besides these (mis-called)
'improvements,' so admirable an Editor should have <i>modernized</i>
throughout, the <span class="smcap">ORTHOGRAPHY</span> equally of <span class="smcap">Marlowe</span> and
of <span class="smcap">Davies</span>: and all the more, that in his 'Notes' he adheres
to the original orthography whenever he quotes from his wealth of
illustrative extracts. The annotation condemns the text. Without
any hesitation therefore, I have set aside Mr. Dyce's reprints, and
returned (as <i>supra</i>) to Davies' own text and orthography, saving a
slight reduction of capitals and italics. None the less do I owe thanks
to Mr. Dyce for his kind permission kindly given, to use any 'Notes'
that might be deemed interesting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> Those that I have taken are marked
with his initial, D. I have to add another important correction of Mr.
Dyce. After describing the <span class="smcap">Harleian MS.</span> he observes "Though it
is of a date considerably posterior to the first appearance in print
of <i>Epigrams by I. D.</i>, perhaps <span class="smcap">all the pieces which it exhibits
are from the pen of Davies</span>. (page 353.) <span class="smcap">Homer</span> nods here:
for on reading these additional 'Epigrams' thus assigned to Davies,
I at once discovered that they consisted merely of a like blundering
transcript of the "Satyricall Epigrams" of <span class="smcap">Henry Hutton</span>,
Dunelmensis, that were appended to his "Follie's Anatomie or Satyres"
(1619.) The oversight is the more noticeable in that all these were
reprinted in 1842, (edited by Rimbault), for the Percy Society, whereof
Mr. Dyce was one of the most effective members of Council.</p>

<p>I confess that it was far from a disappointment to find that the
'Epigrams' of Davies were not to be increased to the extent they would
have been had I accepted Mr. Dyce's opinion, and failed to discover the
Hutton-authorship of nearly all those in the Manuscript, additional to
his acknowledged ones. Nevertheless in the Appendix to our reprint of
the 'Epigrams' I give certain additions from this Manuscript, that are
found neither in Davies's nor Hutton's publications, but which seem to
me to have the <i>ring</i> of Davies in them. The remainder&mdash;prefixed and
affixed&mdash;may well be left in Manuscript. See the Memorial-Introduction
for more on these Epigrams. G.</p>

<p>As explained in the Note, page 6 <i>ante</i>, I have gleaned a few additions
to these Epigrams. At close of those of <span class="smcap">Hutton</span>,&mdash;in the MS.
marked 60 and in Hutton's own volume 56,&mdash;on folio 15<i>d</i>, is the word
'finis.' Immediately under this, the MS. is continued in the same
handwriting on to folio 19, whereon 'finis' is again placed: and on
folios 19 and 20 Lines 'of Tobacco' with 'finis' once more. These Lines
on 'Tobacco' are curious: and somewhat resemble those on 'Moly' given
in the Hitherto Unpublished Poems of Davies, onward. G.</p>

<p class="ph3">NOTE.</p>


<p>These 'Gullinge Sonnets' were first printed in my reproduction of
the Dr. Farmer MS. for the Chetham Society (2 vols. 4to., 1873) in
Part I. pp. 76-81. There seems no question that these Sonnets belong
to Sir John Davies. Besides the "J. D." and "Mr. Dauyes" of the MS.,
his most marked turns of thought and epithet are readily discernible
in them. See critical remarks on them and their probable <i>motif</i> in
Memorial-Introduction.</p>

<p>The Sir Anthony Cooke to whom these Sonnets are dedicated descended
from the Sir Anthony who was Preceptor to King Edward VI., and
for Letters from whom whoso cares may consult the "Reformation"
correspondence of the Parker Society. His daughter Mildred was second
wife of Lord Burleigh, and his daughter Anne was mother of <i>the</i> Bacon.
His son and heir, Richard Cooke, died in 1579, and was succeeded by his
son Anthony (this Sir Anthony), who was knighted in 1596 by the Earl of
Essex at the sacking of Cadiz. He was buried at Romford, Essex, on the
28th December, 1604. G.</p>

lightly by them, but I no sooner had them, but I made a
vow, that as they came to my hands by Fortune, so I
would not part with them but by Fortune. To that end
I haue euer since carried these Lots about me, that if I met
with fit company I might deuide my booty among them.
And now, (I thanke my good Fortune,)! I am lighted
into the best company of the world, a company of the fairest
Ladyes that euer I saw. Come Ladies try your fortunes,

thinke that Fortune doth but mock her in these trifles, and

<p class="ph2">X. EPITAPH AND EPIGRAM.</p>

<p>Sir John Davies had a son who became, if he were not born, an idiot.
Anthony-a-Wood states "The son dying, Sir John made an epitaph of four
verses on him, beginning</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hic in visceribus terræ &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is much to be wished that these 'four verses' were recovered.
Further, he had a daughter named 'Lucy'; and of her the same authority
writes: "So that the said Lucy being sole heiress to her father,
Ferdinando, Lord Hastings, (afterwards Earl of Huntingdon) became a
suitor to her for marriage; whereupon the father made this Epigram:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

Davies. See as remarkable ones on the mother Eleanor Davies, <i>Reveal O

<p class="ph3">METAPHRASE OF SOME OF THE PSALMS, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="ph3">NOTE.</p>


<p>The <span class="smcap">Manuscript Volume</span> from which the following hitherto
unpublished <span class="smcap">Poems</span> are taken, is the property of <span class="smcap">David
Laing</span>, Esq., LL.D., <span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, who purchased it, or
perhaps obtained it in exchange many years ago from the Rev. John
Jamieson, D.D., author of the "Scottish Dictionary" and other learned
works&mdash;a scholar of full learning and to be held in honour in many
respects. It was parted with to his like-minded friend as containing
the hitherto unprinted 'Psalms,' &amp;c., by <span class="smcap">Sir John Davies</span>; but
no memorial remains to ascertain the quarter from whence Dr. Jamieson
obtained the Volume. Mr. Laing states that, if anything was said at the
time on the subject, it has escaped his recollection; and this cannot
be wondered at, as it must have been from thirty to forty years ago.</p>

<p>Along with eminent Experts I have carefully compared this Manuscript
with undoubted holographs of <span class="smcap">Sir John Davies</span>, preserved in Her
Majesty's State Paper Office (State Papers: Domestic. James I. Vol.
173. No. 54: Oct. 18, 1624, etc., etc.) and among the Harleian MSS. in
the British Museum&mdash;the former being preferable as being of the same
year-date with ours: and I feel constrained to pronounce it throughout
non-autograph. There are at least <span class="smcap">FIVE</span> handwritings in the
volume&mdash;as more particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> described <i>in locis</i>: but none bears a
resemblance to <span class="smcap">Sir John Davies'</span>. The Manuscript, therefore,
belongs to a class that abounds at the Period, viz, a Scribe's
transcript and which closely resembles that of MS. Speeches and other
writings of <span class="smcap">Davies</span> preserved among the <span class="smcap">Harleian</span> MSS.
This is further, in accord with <span class="smcap">Sir John Davies'</span> practice,
as appears by 'The Egerton Papers' of Mr. Collier, (Camden Society,
1840, I Vol. 40.) where in a letter to <span class="smcap">Ellesmere</span> (pp. 410-16)
he apologizes for his own 'ill hand' and substitutes his 'man's.' The
evidence for <span class="smcap">Davies'</span> authorship of these <span class="smcap">Poems</span> is
<span class="smcap">EXTERNAL</span> and <span class="smcap">INTERNAL</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The existence of the 'Metaphrase of the Psalms'&mdash;which composes
the greater portion of the Manuscript&mdash;has long been on record. Thus
<span class="smcap">Anthony-a-Wood</span> in his <span class="smcap">Athenæ</span> states "Besides the
before-mentioned things (as also Epigrams, as 'tis said) which were
published by, and under the name of Sir John Davies, are several MSS.
of his writing and composing, which go from hand to hand, as (I)
Metaphrase of several of K. David's Psalms...." (edn. <span class="smcap">Bliss</span>
ii., 403.) The original of the Psalms' MS. was in possession of Sir
John's own daughter, the Countess of Huntingdon, as I found in the
Carte MSS. Bodleian, Oxford.</p></div>

<p>The others are MSS.&mdash;some in part since published&mdash;which <span class="smcap">Wood</span>
describes as formerly in the Library of Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> James Ware, and then in
that of the Earl of Clarendon.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>b</i>) The handwriting of the Manuscript is exactly correspondent with
that of its date '1624.' It is uniform from Psalm I. to L.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Throughout the 'Psalms' and other Poems, favourite words of
<span class="smcap">Sir John Davies'</span> occur: in part peculiar to him or used in
a peculiar way. I must refer the Student to the Poems themselves for
the great majority of examples: but note here half-a-dozen&mdash;all the
references being to our own edition of the previous Poems.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. '<i>Withall</i>': "... that sinne that we are borne <i>withall</i>." ('Nosce
Teipsum' page 57, stanza 5th, line 4th.) So in the 'Psalms':<br />


"Be merciful and hear my prayer <i>withall</i>." (Ps. 4th, line 4th.)</p>


<p>2. '<i>Wight</i>': "... this World below did need one <i>wight</i>." (page 60:
stanza 4th, line 1st.) So in the 'Psalms': "... measures Iustice vnto
euery <i>wight</i>." (Ps. 9th, line 16th.)</p>



<p>3. '<i>gray Winter</i>': "Here flow'ry Spring-tide and there <i>Winter
gray</i>." (page 63, stanza 1st, line 4th.) So in 'A Maid's Hymne in
praise of Virginity': "To whome <i>graye Winter</i> neuer doth apeare."
(line 7th.)</p>

<p>4. '<i>On</i>' meaning '<i>o'er</i>': "Will holds the royall scepter <i>on</i> the
soul" ('Nosce Teipsum,' page 79,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> stanza 2nd, line 3rd.) "And <i>on</i> the
passions of the heart doth raigne." (page 79, stanza 2d, line 4th.)
So in the 'Psalms': "Let not my foes trihumph <i>on</i> mee againe." (Ps.
35th, line 37th). "In that my foe doth not trihumph <i>on</i> me." (Ps.
41st, line 22d.)</p>

<p>5. '<i>Detruded</i>': "... such as me <i>detruded</i> downe to Hell." (page 110,
stanza 1st, line 1st.) So in the 'Psalms': Therefore although my soule
<i>detruded</i> were euen to Hell's gates.... (Ps. 23rd, line 7th.)</p>

<p>6. '<i>Center</i>' meaning '<i>Earth</i>': "Suruey all things that on this
<i>center</i> here." (page 25th, stanza 1st, line 4th.) So in the 'Psalms':
"And all that dwell on his round <i>Center</i> here." (Ps. 23rd, line 16th.)</p></div>

<p>It were easy to multiply these instances from the 'Psalms' and the
other Poems.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The secular Poems contain personal allusions that authenticate
their authorship. In the 'Elegie of Loue' and in the lines "To the
Kinge vpon his Ma<sup>ties</sup> first comming into England" these are of
singular interest and value. The latter harmonizes with the fact that
<span class="smcap">Sir John Davies</span> proceeded North to meet the King: and it has
a direct reference to his 'Nosce Teipsum.' Speaking of his Muse he
exclaims,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy sight had once an influence divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which gave it power the Soul of man to vew."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>Another personal allusion is found in his address to the "Ladyes of
Founthill" in his native Wilts.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The "Verses sent to the Kinge with ffiges" is inscribed "by Sir
John Davis" and the "Elegiacal Epistle" which immediately follows these
'Verses' naturally closes a Volume containing the compositions of our
Worthy. 'Davis' is his own spelling in the 1608 edition of 'Nosce
Teipsum,' and in Davison's 'Rhapsody.'</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Exclusive of the 'Psalms'&mdash;the Davies' authorship of which admits
of no doubt&mdash;the other Poems have Sir John Davies' characteristics in
choice of subjects and style, and specific wording, as above. 'Elegie'
is herein used as in the title-page of 'Nosce Teipsum.'</p></div>

<p>The Manuscript is a thin folio of forty-one leaves and one page: but
<i>verso</i> of 35th leaf consists of Memoranda headed "The State of England
before the Conquest, briefely. By Henry, Lord Hastings, amongst his
Notes found": and leaves 36 and 37 and page 38 (<i>verso</i> blank) contain
'Notes' on "William Bastarde, the Norman Conquerour of England." The
former is in a handwriting different from all the rest: the latter
the same as the Poems that follow "Part of an Elegie in prayse of
Marriage." There are a number of contemporary and of more recent blank
leaves. It is bound in dark calf, with tooled ornament in the centre.</p>

<p>In preparing this Manuscript for the Press, my anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> endeavour
has been faithfully to reproduce the original: only I have extended
the contractions 'w<sup>h</sup> and w<sup>ch</sup>' for 'with' and 'which' and
'o<sup>r</sup>. y<sup>r</sup>' for 'our' and 'your' and the like. I have
somewhat modified the capitals: but in the Divine names (nouns and
pronouns) and impersonations, have employed capitals. The punctuation
of the Manuscript is almost <i>nil</i>: I have adopted present usage on a
uniform principle; and also the apostrophe of the possessive case, &amp;c.
Only one point perplexed me a little, viz. the sign of the plural. At
the period a peculiar form represented 'es' as denoting plural, but
examination showed our Manuscript as using it with 'e' immediately
before. Hence it is apparent the Scribe used it arbitrarily. My rule
has been to represent it simply by 's' for our plural, except in the
cases&mdash;pointed out where they occur&mdash;in which 'es' as an additional
syllable is required for the rhythm. Throughout, the orthography is
literally preserved: and besides six collations of my transcript
with the Original, by myself, I have had the advantage of a minute
comparison by my experienced and erudite friend, the late John Bruce,
Esq., of London, and in part by W. Aldis Wright, Esq., M.A., Trinity
College, Cambridge. So that our first publication of the Manuscript
may be relied on as absolutely true to the Original. It may be added
that I have adhered to the order in which the several Poems are given,
with the single exception of placing the anonymous very noticeable
'Elegiacal Epistle'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> on the death of Davies last. The two short pieces
that precede it in our Volume, occupy in the MS. the closing page,
which is a kind of fly-leaf.</p>

<p>I feel assured that every admirer of Sir John Davies will agree with
me that a deep debt of gratitude is due to Mr. Laing for his generous
consent to have the Manuscript included in our editions of the 'Poems.'
Independent of the interest attaching to their illustrious authorship
the 'Psalms' seem to me to possess rare merits, being as a whole
strikingly faithfull to the Original, and not para-phrastic&mdash;hence
Anthony-a-Wood's 'Metaphrase'&mdash;simple yet picturesque, 'smooth' but
melodious, and in every quality infinitely superior to the attempts
of <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>, <span class="smcap">Jeremy Taylor</span>, <span class="smcap">Rous</span>, and others.
Some of the Versions must find a place in the Church's Psalmody and
Hymnology.</p>

<p>I must not omit to acknowledge the courteous attention of Mr. W.
Carew Hazlitt in informing me of the existence and ownership of the
Manuscript. Anything further requiring to be said, will be found in the
footnotes. G.</p>

<p>After the Queene entered (out of the high way) into the Deamesne
grounde of Harefielde, near the Dayrie howse, she was mett with
2 persons, the one representing a <span class="smcap">Bayliffe</span>, the other
a <span class="smcap">Dayrie-Maide</span>, with the Speech. Her Majesty, being on
horsebacke, stayed under a tree (because it rayned) to heare it.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Why, how now, Joane! are you heere? Gods my life, what make
you heere, gaddinge and gazinge after this manner? You come to buy
gape-seede,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> doe you? Wherefore come you abroade now I' faith can

<p><i>B.</i> Strangers? how knew you there would come Strangers?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jo.</i> All this night I could not sleepe, dreaming of greene rushes; and
yesternight the chatting of the pyes, and the chirkinge<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> of the
frisketts<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> did foretell as much; and, besides that, all this day my

wil) allwaies a signe of Strangers, if it be in the Summer; marye, if
it be in the Winter, tis a signe of anger. But what make you in this
company, I pray you?</p>

<p><i>B.</i> I make the way for these Strangers, which the Way-maker himself
could not doe; for it is a way was never passed before. Besides, the
Mrs. of this faire company, though she know the way to all men's
harts, yet she knowes the way but to few men's howses, except she love
them very well, I can tell you; and therefore I myselfe, without any
comission, have taken upon me to conduct them to the house.</p>

<p><i>Jo.</i> The house? which house? doe you remember yourselfe? which way goe
you?</p>

<p><i>B.</i> I goe this way, on the right hand. Which way should I goe?</p>

<p><i>Jo.</i> You say true, and you're a trim man; but I' faith I'll talke noe
more to you, except you ware wyser.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> I pray you hartely, 'forsooth,
come neare the house, and take a simple lodginge with vs to-night;
for I can assuere you that yonder house that he talks of is but a
Pigeon-house, which is very little if it were finisht, and yet very
little of it is finisht. And you will believe me, vpon my life, Lady, I
saw Carpenters and Bricklayers and other Workmen about it within less
than these two howers. Besides, I doubt my Mr. and Mrs. are not at
home; or, if they be, you must make your owne provision; for they have
noe provision for such Strangers. You should seeme to be Ladies; and we
in the country have an old saying, that "halfe a pease a day will serve
a Lady." I know not what you are, nether am I acquainted with your
dyet; but, if you will goe with me, you shall haue cheare for a Lady:
for first you shall have a dayntie sillibub; next a messe of clowted
creame; stroakings,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> in good faith, redd cowes milk, and they say
in London that's restorative: you shall have greene cheeses and creame.

[were here] she might be seene to eat of it. Wee will not greatly

<p><i>B.</i> Goe to, gossip; your tongue must be running. If my Mrs. should
heare of this, I' faith shee would give you little thankes I can tell
you, for offeringe to draw so faire a flight from her Pigeon-house (as
you call it) to your Dayrie-house.</p>

<p><i>Jo.</i> Wisely, wisely, brother Richard; I' faith as I would vse the
matter, I dare say shee would giue me great thankes: for you know my
Mrs. charged me earnestly to retaine all idele hearvest-folkes that
past this way; and my meaning was, that, if I could hold them all this
night and to-morrow, on Monday morning to carry them into the fields;
and to make them earne their entertaynment well and thriftily; and to
that end I have heere a <i>Rake</i> and <i>Forke</i>, to deliver to the best
Huswife in all this company.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Doe soe then: deliver them to the best Hus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>wife in all this
company: for wee shall haue as much vse of her paines and patience
there as here. As for the dainties that you talke of, if you have any
such, you shall doe well to send them; and as for these strangers, sett
thy hart at rest, Joane; they will not rest with [thee] this night, but
will passe on to my Mr[s.] house.</p>

<p><i>Joa.</i> Then, I pray, take this <i>Rake</i> and <i>Forke</i> with you; but I am
ashamed, and woe at my hart, you should goe away soe late. And I pray
God you repent you not, and wish yourselves here againe, when you finde
you haue gone further and fared worsse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span> <i>with yeollow haire, and in a green roabe, with a hower
glasse, stopped, not runninge</i>.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> Wellcome, good <i>Time</i>.</p>

<p><i>T.</i> Godden, my little pretie priuat <i>Place</i>.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> Farewell, godbwy <i>Time</i>; are you not gone? doe you stay heere? I
wonder that <i>Time</i> should stay any where; what's the cause?</p>

<p><i>T.</i> If thou knewest the cause, thou wouldst not wonder; for I stay
to entertaine the Wonder of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> time; wherein I would pray thee to
ioyne mee, if thou wert not too little for her greatnes; for it weare
as great a meracle for thee to receive her, as to see the Ocean shut up
in a little creeke, or the circumference shrinke vnto the pointe of the
center.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> Too little! by that reason shee should rest in noe <i>place</i>, for
no <i>place</i> is great ynough to receive her. Too little! I have all this
day entertayned the Sunn, which, you knowe, is a great and glorious
Guest; hee's but euen now gone downe yonder hill; and now he is gone,
methinks, if Cinthia her selfe would come in his place, the place that
contaynde him should not be to little to receave her.</p>

<p><i>T.</i> You say true, and I like your comparison; for the Guest that wee
are to entertaine doth fill all places with her divine vertues, as
the Sunn fills the World with the light of his beames. But say, poore
<i>Place</i>, in what manner didst thou entertaine the Sunn?</p>

<p><i>P.</i> I received his glory, and was fill'd with it: but I must confesse,
not according to the proportion of his greatnes, but according to the
measure of my capacitie; his bright face (methought) was all day turned
vpon mee; nevertheless his beames in infinite abundance weere disperst
and spread vpon other places.</p>

<p><i>T.</i> Well, well; this is noe time for vs to entertaine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> one another,
when wee should ioine to entertaine her. Our entertaynment of this
Goddesse will be much alike; for though her selfe shall eclipse her
soe much, as to suffer her brightnes to bee shadowed in this obscuere
and narrow <i>Place</i>, yet the sunne beames that follow her, the traine I
meane that attends vpon her, must, by the necessitie of this <i>Place</i>,
be deuided from her. Are you ready, <i>Place</i>? <i>Time</i> is ready.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> Soe it should seeme, indeed, you are so gaye, fresh, and
cheerfull. You are the present <i>Time</i>, are you not? then what neede you
make such haste? Let me see, your wings are clipt, and, for ought I
see, your hower-glasse runnes not.</p>

<p><i>T.</i> My wings are clipt indeed, and it is her hands hath clipt them:
and, tis true, my glasse runnes not: indeed it hath bine stopt a longe
time, it can never rune as long as I waite upon this Mris. I [am] her
<i>Time</i>; and <i>Time</i> weare very vngratefull, if it should not euer stand
still, to serue and preserue, cherish and delight her, that is the
glory of her time, and makes the <i>Time</i> happy wherein she liueth.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> And doth not she make <i>Place</i> happy as well as <i>Time</i>? What if she
make thee a contynewall holy-day, she makes me a perpetuall sanctuary.
Doth not the presence of a Prince make a Cottage a Court, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
presence of the Gods make euery place Heauen? But, alas, my littlenes
is not capable of that happines that her great grace would impart vnto
me: but, weare I as large as there harts that are mine Owners, I should
be the fairest <i>Pallace</i> in the world; and weere I agreeable to the
wishes of there hartes, I should in some measure resemble her sacred
selfe, and be in the outward frount exceeding faire, and in the inward
furniture exceeding rich.</p>

<p><i>T.</i> In good time do you remember the hearts of your Owners; for, as
I was passing to this place, I found this <i>Hart</i>,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> which, as my
daughter <i>Truth</i> tould mee, was stolne by owne<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> of the Nymphes
from one of the seruants of this Goddesse; but her guiltie conscience
enforming her that it did belong only of right vnto her that is Mrs.
of all harts in the world, she cast [it] from her for this time; and
<i>Oportunity</i>, finding it delivered it vnto me. Heere, <i>Place</i>, take it
thou, and present it vnto her as a pledge and mirror of their harts
that owe thee.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> It is a mirror indeed, for so it is transparent. It is a cleare
hart, you may see through it. It hath noe close corners, noe darkenes,
noe unbutifull spott in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> I will therefore presume the more boldly
to deliver it; with this assurance, that <i>Time</i>, <i>Place</i>, <i>Persons</i>,
and all other circumstances, doe concurre alltogether in biddinge her
wellcome.</p>

<p><i>P.</i> Sweet Maiestie, be pleased to looke vpon a poore Wydow, mourning
before your Grace. I am this <i>Place</i>, which at your comming was full
of ioy; but now at your departure am as full of sorrow. I was then,
for my comfort, accompanied with the present cheerful <i>Time</i>; but now
he is to depart with you; and, blessed as he is, must euer fly before
you: But, alas! I haue no wings, as <i>Time</i> hath. My heauiness is such,
that I must stand still, amazed to see so greate happines so sone
bereft mee. Oh, that I could remoue with you, as other circumstances
can! <i>Time</i> can goe with you, <i>Persons</i> can goe with you; they can
moue like Heaven; but I, like dull Earth (as I am indeed) must stand
vnmouable. I could wish my selfe like the inchanted Castle of Loue,
to hould you heere for euer, but that your vertues would dissolue all
my inchauntments. Then what remedy? As it is against the nature of an
Angell to be circumscribed in <i>Place</i>, so it is against the nature
of <i>Place</i> to haue the motion of an Angell. I must stay forsaken and
desolate. You may goe with maiestie, joy, and glory. My only suyte,
before you goe, is that you will pardon the close imprisonment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> which

you take this Anchor with you. And I pray to Him that made both <i>Time</i>

Elephant was an object of great wonder and long remembered. A curious
illustration of this is found in <i>The Metamorphosis of the Walnut

by Sir John Harington determines that he is the Lepidus of this
passage, and that his favourite dog Bungey is the "printed dog." In
a compartment of the engraved title-page to Harington's <i>Orlando
Furioso</i>, 1591, is a representation of Bungey (see too the Annotations
on Book xli. of that poem); and hence he is termed by Davies the

collection of early English poetry called the 'Poetical Rhapsody' by
Davison. Our text is from the third edition (1621) which in our case is
preferable, as having presumably been revised (in his contributions) by
Sir John: It is to be noted that in this edition the original simple I.
D. is in the second poem changed to Sir I. D., and that to the third
his name is given in full. I have included the Hymn on Music, though
the initials I. D. have been assigned to Dr. John Donne by Sir Egerton
Brydges and others. It seems to me that as (1) I. D. is our Poet's
designation in the 'Rhapsody' throughout, and as (2) the Lines were
not claimed for Donne by himself, or by his son when he collected his
father's Poems&mdash;we are warranted in assigning them to Sir John Davies.
Sir Egerton favours their Donne authorship simply because "they seem
rather to partake of the conceits of Donne than of the simple vigour
of Davies" but he forgot the 'Hymnes to Astræa' and 'Orchestra'; which
are in the same vein. It is to be regretted that Sir Nicholas Harris
Nicolas <i>modernized</i> the text in his reprint of the 'Rhapsody': (2
vols. crown 8vo. 1826, Pickering): and perhaps equally so, that Mr.
Collier in his careful and beautiful private one, has selected the
first incomplete edition. The following is the title-page of the

the present Poem, <i>e. g.</i> "Sundry devises at hir entrance: three

Williams, in her careful edition of <span class="smcap">Chamberlain's</span> Letters

have been addressed to the Lord Chancellor, on the death of his second

speakes of 3 kindes of Companions, Men, Women, and Bookes: the losse
of this second makes you retire from the first: I have, therefore,

went nearer it in the new line, "All those," &amp;c., thinking perhaps of
varying the first line to "tride as gold;" but on reflection, seeing
that was bad, left it as at first, albeit he must have neglected to

the prefatory Note to these Psalms was written, I have discovered
among the Harleian MSS. a very remarkable document by Sir John Davies,
viz. his "Plea spoken at the Bar of the House of Lords" on "the King's
power to impose Ship-money," (126. B 10-4266) and it is <i>identically
the same holograph with that of these Fifty Psalms</i>, presenting
precisely the same forms and contractions throughout. So that the
Scribe of the one must have been the Scribe of the other: no doubt
one of Sir John's Secretaries or 'men,' as he himself calls them. I
shall give above important historical Paper&mdash;which never has been
published, or even referred to, so far as I am aware&mdash;in my edition
of <span class="smcap">Davies'</span> Prose Works. Meanwhile I need not point out how
valuable is this additional verification of the Davies authorship of
our Manuscript&mdash;that is in so far as the Psalms up to L. are concerned.
I stand in doubt of his authorship of the remainder; but see our
Memorial-Introduction on this.

<p>
The Psalms that follow have interposed a half-page and one leaf, blank,
and another leaf, filled with the secular Poems that succeed them: but
it was deemed better to place all the Psalms together. These other
Psalms have the same orthography: but the hand-writing is different
and plainer. It will be noticed that Psalm L. <i>supra</i>, is
imperfect, extending only to v. 13. G.</p></div>

taken the ending 'the' for the article. Both point to the true reading,
'Nepenthe Helen's drink.' It is impossible that a scholar like Davies
could have supposed 'Nepenthe' to be the drink of the gods, and equally
impossible that he could have thought it drink of the Hellenes. G.</p></div>
